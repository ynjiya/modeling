Assignment: Simulate a queueing model: system consisting of a generator, memory and service apparatus. The generator submits messages distributed according to a uniform law, they come to memory and are selected for processing according to the Poisson law. The number of applications is set. Provide for the case when the processed application is returned back to the queue. Determine the optimal queue length at which there will be no lost messages. Implement in two ways: using step-by-step and event approaches
