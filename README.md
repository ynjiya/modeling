## Mathematical modeling

* Implementation of the approximate analytical method and numerical algorithms of the first and second orders of accuracy in solving the Cauchy problem for ODEs.

* Implementation of the Difference Method in Solving the Boundary Value Problem for the ODE System using Runge-Kutta and Euler methods

* Custom test for randomness using entropy and sequence distribution analysis

* Implementation of methods: 
    - Monte Carlo
    - Repeated matrix multiplication 
    - Left Eigen vectors

    to determine the residence time of a complex system based on Markov chains in all its states, and to determine the moment of reaching the probabilistic constant, as well as its value 


* Simulate a queueing model: system consisting of a generator, memory and service apparatus. The generator submits messages distributed according to a uniform law, they come to memory and are selected for processing according to the Poisson law. The number of applications is set. Provide for the case when the processed application is returned back to the queue. Determine the optimal queue length at which there will be no lost messages. Implement in two ways: using step-by-step and event approaches

* Implementation of uniform and normal distribution
